Card-game is the port of the famous SET game on a rails app.

Principles of the game :
  - there is a deck of 81 cards
  - 4 characteristics describe those cards, each of these chacateristics can take three states :
     number of pictures on the card (1, 2, or 3)
     shape of the pictures (rectangle, ellipse or -dunno the name in english-)
     background of the pictures (solid, greyed or empty)
     color of the pictures (red, green or magenta)

The goal of the game is to pick sets of three cards that have, for each characteristics, the same status or three different status.

The game being under development, all the possible sets are actually shown for convenience.

The future of this app is to have a massively playable set game.
